# Hello, Incoming CSE 15L Students and Myself!
## I am going to do my best to show you how to setup **Remote Access**

***
1. First, you are going to want to install Visual Studio Code by going [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and clicking
   download for your Operating System.
   
2. After installing, we are going to try to remotely connect to a server at UCSD.  If you are on Windows you will need to 
   install the program *OpenSSH* [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui). This will allow you to connect to other systems that use this type of account.
   
   Now you can either use the terminal built in to your computer or you can use Visual Studio Code. I personally opted to use the
   built in terminal. If you are using VSCode press *Ctrl* or *Command +*. Now input the command `ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` but 
   replace the `zz` with the letters in your course-specific account.
   Input your password and connect to the server! It should look something like this: 
   
3. Now try using some commands! Some of the basic commands are `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `cp`. After using some commands 
   you can log out of the remote server by using *Ctrl-D* or use the command `exit`.
